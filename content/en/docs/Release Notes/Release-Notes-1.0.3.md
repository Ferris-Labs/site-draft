## Improved <img src="/images/improved_green.png" alt="improved_green" style="zoom:25%;" />

- [x] We have improved elements of the **Security and Access Rights Management** in the areas of User and Access Management (Keycloak), Certificates Management as well as Authentication and Authorization (OpenID). Each role has its own set of permissions, which makes it possible to restrict users access to specific areas of the platform based on their role.
- [x] Parametrised **Workflows** can be defined with by users with easy json files by following a specific set of rules. Complex use cases are supported such as chaining multiple actions one by another and having control over what happens in a different scenarios. Built in approval capability for each workflow action is supported and easy to implement by default.
- [x] The new **Ferris Executor** has become even better and more powerful. Add any Python, SQL or JSON to execute any type of jobs.
- [x] The **Scheduler** is now fully embedded with the Executor.
- [x] **Files Upload** has improved and is integrated with the Workflow and Approvals functionality. Files have type specific validation and are stored in different buckets. Bucket creation can be done within the same FAB module. 
- [x] The **Ferris Application Builder (FAB)** is now capable of auto generating new pages (UI) on the fly.
