### Executive summary
To support advisors and clients with a “next best product” recommendation, a closed loop flow has been established
from Research / Chief Investment Officer to Relationship Managers and eventually to the client.
Evaluating which recommendations worked for RMs and Clients allowed for a learning loop informing Research & CIO
to improve selection & tailoring of investment themes.

### Problem statement
The information flow from research or strategic asset allocation (CIO) to client advisors and eventually to clients does rarely follow
a structured path. Instead the bank‘s “house view” is communicated broadly to all front-office staff and portfolio managers.
They then use their direct client relationship to assess risk appetite and extract specific investment themes or
ideas from their client interaction. If these match, the resulting research / advice is forwarded to the client.
It seems like a lucky punch if product information leads to a trade / product sale.

### Target market / Industries
The challenge of customizing the offering to the customer profile is a common challenge across the industries.
Financial services industry is benefiting most from this use case that can be efficiently applied e.g. in
Industries, that are benefitting most of this use-case are:
- Banks
- Investment and finance firms
- Real estate brokers
- Tax and accounting firms
- Insurance companies

### Solution
Starting with investment themes / product and occasion specific sales / investment opportunities,
the existing client‘s portfolios and client to bank communication is screened for possible gap / fit.
Research or asset allocation can then focus their efforts on topics suggested by front-office staff and / or clients themselves.
Observing and identifying trade success the best practices are understood and can be multiplied across other (similar) client scenarios.
Asset allocation and advisors work collaboratively as they both evaluate which information / proposals / investment ideas are
forwarded to clients (and then accepted or not) and which ones are kept back by advisors (and for what reasons).

The solution included:
- Clustering & topic mapping of existing marketing material & client portfolio structures
- Optionally inclusion of CRM notes and written advisor to client communication
- Sales Ontology setup & learning loop inclusion & topic matching
- Identification of individual investment themes / topics of interest
- Aggregation of findings, reporting, alerting & action recommendation
