### Executive summary
Multi-dimensional and ontology-based classification of products along different regulatory frameworks
and systematic mapping of the company's internal specialist expertise in a knowledge graph that can be used
by both humans and algorithms or other systems.

### Problem statement
Depending on the applicable regulation, the products and materials need to be classified for further usage.
This requires an effective classification approach and also involves the challenge of knowledge management.
Respective product / material information need to be extracted from various sources, such as core systems,
product information systems, etc. This task usually requires lots of time-consuming manual work utilizing the domain knowledge.

### Target market / Industries
The use case can be efficiently applied in the following industries:
- Financial services
- Manufacturing
- Retail

### Solution
The solution is based on analyzing the domain knowledge and converting it into ontology.
Domain knowledge is used as an input for the Machine Learning (ML) model: ontology-based annotator component
is analyzing the available data, be it text, unstructured or semi-structured data and feed it
into the ML model to perform the classification. The event-based workflow increases the efficiency and
stability of the classification process.

### Stakeholders
- Management
- Product management
- Domain experts
- Management

### Data elements, Assets and Deliverables
As an Input from the client, the following items were used:
- Domain expertise in the ontology
- Detailed data that needs to be classified

Assets & Artefacts:
- Ontology-based annotator (DFA)
- Workflow engine

The deliverables included:
- Automated classification data or documents – final workflow

### Impact and benefits
The classification process, that cannot be done manually
with reasonable manpower and time resources is now automated.
