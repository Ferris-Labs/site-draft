## Prospect 360°


### Executive summary
For many strategic prospects the preparation of possible offers and establishment of a real relationship either involves great effort or lacks structure and focus. The Prospect 360° use case augments traditional advisor intelligence with automation to improve this original dilemma.

<!-- 2 Problem statement -->
### Problem statement
Hunting for new important clients usually is driven by referrals and the search for an “ideal event“ to introduce a product or service. Existing client relationships are usually screened manually and approached directly to request an introduction, prior to offering any services. Monitoring the market and a prospect’s connections can be cumbersome and is error prone – either introductions are awkward or they do not focus on a specific and urgent need. Hence the success and conversion rates seem hard to plan.

<!-- 3 Target markets -->
### Target market / Industries
This use case is traditionally applicable to such industries where the customer engagement and acquisition process is long and costs per customer are high:

* Financial Services
* Insurance
* General Business Services

<!-- 4 Solution description -->

### Solution
We introduce the idea of “soft onboarding”. Instead of selling hard to a new prospect, we start to engage them with tailored and relevant pieces of information or advice free of charge. We do, however, tempt this prospect to embrace little initial pieces of an onboarding-like process, extending the period we are allowed to profile the needs and preferences of the client and the related social graph. Turning a prospect into an interested party and then increasing the levels of engagement of the period of up to six months allows for a more natural and client-driven advisory experience, that is shifting from a “product push” towards a “client pull”.

The solution included:

- Integration of disparate news & event information sources (licensed & public origins)
- Provisioning of select RM & client data points to understand social graphs
- Word parsing of text-based inputs (e.g. news articles and liquidity event streams)
- Onboarding & Sales Ontology matching
- Identification of possible liquidity events, new referral paths & sales topics of interest
- Aggregation of findings, reporting, notifications and organizational routing
- Ideally inclusion of reinforcement learning (via RM, client & assistant feedback loops)

### Testimonials

> "I feel a lot more as a real advisor. I can be helpful and feel informed. And I still can make my own judgments of what is relevant for my personal relationship to existing clients and new referrals. I learn as the system learns."
