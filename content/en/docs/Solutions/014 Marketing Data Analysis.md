## Marketing Data Analysis

### Executive summary
Implemented the first service- and on-demand based big data and data science infrastructure for the bank. Data pipelines are built and maintained leveraging two key infrastructure components: a custom-built aggregation tool and the marketing content & event platform. The aggregation tool builds the data lake for all analytics activities and enables the marketing platform to organically grow customer and campaign projects.

### Problem statement
Relationship Managers spend too much valuable time researching talking points and themes that fit their different client profiles. A simple product recommender usually cannot grasp the complexity of private banking relationships and hence the product recommendations are usually without impact.

### Target market / Industries
Private banking, wealth management,
All relationship intense industries, i.e. insurance

### Solution
Jointly with the client we developed a private banking marketing ontology (knowledge graph or rule book) that enabled various Machine Learning (ML) models to parse broad catalogue of unstructured data (financial research, company analysis, newsfeeds) to generate personalized investment themes and talking points.

The solution included:
- Private banking marketing ontology
- Thematic aggregator agents
- Personalized clustering
