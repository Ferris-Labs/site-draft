## Regulatory Single Source of Truth

### Executive summary
Leveraging all existing data sources from core banking, risk- and trading systems to the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and general ledger as granular input for your regulatory Single Source of Truth (SSoT).

### Problem statement
Most regulatory solutions today require huge maintenance effort on both business and technology teams. Ever more granular and ever more near-time regulatory requirements further increase this pressure. Usually the various regulatory domains have created and continue to create silos for central bank, credit risk, liquidity, Anti-Money Laundering (ALM) / Know Your Customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring regulations. Further requirements from ePrivacy, Product Suitability and Sustainability regulations even further dilute these efforts.

### Target market / Industries
- Financial services
- Insurance

### Solution
Leveraging the semantic integration capabilities of {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} Data Platform, it  allows you to reuse all the integration efforts you have previously started and yet converge on a common path towards an integrated (regulatory) enterprise view. The ability to eliminate high-maintenance Extraction Transformation Loading (ETL) coding or ETL tooling in favor of a transparent and business driven process will save you money during the initial implementation and during ongoing maintenance.
Templates and a proven process were applied to use what exists and build what’s missing without long-term lock in.

The solution included:
- Semantic Integration leveraging all your prior integration investments
- Business driven data standardization and data quality improvements
- No Code implementation => business analysis is sufficient to generate the integration layer
- Implement data governance & data quality via reusable business checks
- Multiply your regulatory investments to be used for analytics, sales and risk

### Stakeholders
- Compliance

### Data elements, Assets and Deliverables
As an Input from the client, the following items were used:
- Full regulatory granular scope master & reference data (incl. UBO hierarchies)
- Client portfolio (positions / transactions)

Assets & Artefacts:

The deliverables included:

### Impact and benefits
The semantic SSoT is now used by other functions across the bank leveraging regulatory investments for sales support, operations and risk management.

The use-case implementation resulted in:

  **9%** reduction of risk weighted assets

  **9 FTE (50%)** reduction of regulatory reporting team

In addition, recurring Cost of Capital savings of over 15m CHF p.a. were achieved.
