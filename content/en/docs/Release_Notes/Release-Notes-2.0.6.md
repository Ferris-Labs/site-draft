## New <img src="/images/added_blue.png" alt="added_blue" style="zoom:25%;" />

- We introduced a new **skip execution** button to prevent scheduled executions in the Ferris Executor from running.
  With this button, users can skip executions until further notice. With the same button, users can unskip executions
  and and thus bring them back into the planned execution cycle.

- We added the ability of a **dynamic priorisations of executions** by forcing a one-time execution on a different
  priority lane, rather than the serviceâ€™s default.
