As for all Ferris components the identity and access management process is centralized and secured through various layers. Working either in a standalone fashion or integrated with enterprise or cloud-based IAM frameworks, the platform is secured along the following dimensions:

1. Network and Transport Layer => airgapped via VPN and virtual network segmente
1. User Federation and Identities => via LDAP and/or SAML
1. Application and Project Level => Use Case, Application and Project roles

All of these layers can be finetuned to existing enterprise standards. As we have deployed the Ferris Data Platform in various regulated and privacy conscious environments (like Financial Services and health related environments) both absolute and relative data privacy and organizational chinese walls can be modelled and complied with.
