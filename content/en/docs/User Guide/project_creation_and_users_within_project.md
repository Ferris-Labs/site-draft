Project on the Ferris Platform form the overarching organizational bracket for different types of objects. All users, packages, scripts, parameters, secrets and other elements are organized into projects to ease enterprise data management. The default owner for new projects is the Platform Admin (PA).  

#### User creation within the project

Since the Platform Administrator created the Project, he is automatically assigned as the Project Owner. All user roles on the project level are defined in detail as follows:

- **Project Owner** -  has all permissions on project and related entities (packages, users) including deletion of project(s) (and users) created by the PO. By default it is the user that created project
- **Project Admin** - has all permissions as Owner except deletion
- **Project User** - has only list / view permissions

**Please note that users without Platform Administrator role, do not see any projects and packages they are not assigned to. All project role rights are translated to package level also, eg. a user with Project User role will not be able to edit packages of that project, only to list/view them and run a (manual) execution**
