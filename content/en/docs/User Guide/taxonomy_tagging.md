  How to add Tags and the importance of Taxonomy.
---

Taxonomies or Tags describe the ability to organize and structure types and classes of objects and their correlations within executions/packages and workflows across any given application, use case or project. Tags are searchable and makes it easy to group and relate objects across different components and lifecycle stages.

As a generic base module "taggability" can easily be included in any model, use case or application by the developers/users.

**Note: As of the current release the Taxonomy is universal across all projects and use cases and cannot be segregated along different functional domains. It is thus essential to create a unified naming convention to be shared among the different projects & user groups. **
