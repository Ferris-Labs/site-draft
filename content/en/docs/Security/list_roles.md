  Introduction of the Roles concept, including the meaning and application of permissions.

---

## Roles

Roles represent a collection of permissions (or rights) that can be performed within {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}}. Each role is taylored to a specific set of responsibilities and tasks within {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}}.

To get to the the Users page, navigate to: Security > List Roles

*Example: List of {{< param replacables.brand_name  >}} Roles*

Note that each of these capabilities depends on the Permissions given to your Role. Some roles may be given full rights (e.g. add, show, edit, delete), where others may only be given viewing rights (e.g. show). As a result, some users may only be seeing the "Show Roles" magnifying glass icon.
