# Intro to the Ferris documentation

The principle of documentation is simple. We provide as much detail as possible in order to make the technology and the services transparent and easy to understand and adopt.

You will find that the structure of each section is repeated throughout all solution areas:

- Overview
- Capabilties
- Audience specific guides
- Solution snippets, problems solved, links to use cases
- Components and purpose
- Architecture

### Product Catalog Overview

Currently, Ferris DX consists of the following technology and solutions:

- Ferris FX (Executor)
- Ferris SX (Streaming Automation)
- Ferris K8X (Event based Container Management) - *targeted for release in Q1 of 2023*

### Approach to Docs section

Our approach to documenting Ferris is to provide insightful details into the technology while at the same time enabling a self-learning approach.

Wherever possible, we provide real examples with hands-on code and data in our training cloud on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Every code section is highlighted in **code syntax**:

```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

### How to read and apply

We try to document Ferris specifically for each user group and audience. Broadly speaking, this goes towards:

- Software Developers and Engineers
- Platform Engineers and DevOps
- Non-technical users

### Suggestions for improvements welcome!

We're keen to provide the most accurate, complete, useful and consumable documentation as possible. If you find a bug in the documentation or have an idea about improving the documentation, we would like to encourage you to let us know about it!
