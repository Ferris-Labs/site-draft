#### Users

This is us - humans - using Ferris on a day to day basis. And in this section each user is listed with the most important attributes defininig name, e-mail, status and - most importantly - the associated roles.

> To get the the Users page, navigate to: Security > List Users

*Example: List of Ferris Users*

Besides displaying the list of all current users, the Users page offers a number of capabilities:

- Add User ![Add User](/images/add_icon.png)
- Show User ![](/images/view_icon.png)
- Edit User ![](/images/edit_icon.png)
- Delete User ![](/images/delete_icon.png)

*Note that each of these capabilities depends on the Permissions given to your Role. Some roles may be given full rights (e.g. add, show, edit, delete), where others may only be given viewing rights (e.g. show). As a result, some users may only be seeing the "Show User" magnifying glass icon.*

##### Add new User

Adding a new User can be done directly within Ferris by any person who has the necessary permissions to do so. This is normally a designated Security Lead.

Most often though, adding new Users is done by integrating Ferris with the corporate Identity Access Management (IAM) and Single Sign On (SSO) system.

> Click on the plus sign ![Add User](/images/add_icon.png) to add a new user.

*Example: Adding a new Ferris Users*

- **First Name, Last Name**: Full first and last name of the user

- **User Name:** Apply any name or e-mail, but it is advised to adhere to a standard applied to all users.

  *Possible options may include: Email, Company User ID, first name only or full name*

- **Is Active**: Keep this boxed checked as long as the user is actively using Ferris.

  *Uncheck the box once a user is no longer using Ferris. Delete the user after a prolonged period of inactivity.*

- **Email:** The users email is the primary means of identification and communication.

- **Role**: This is where one or more roles - and therefore permissions - are associated with each user.

  *Roles are setup in advance, and only already existing roles may be selected. A user may be associated to multiple roles.*

- **Save:** Always save!
