## The Ferris Suite
The Ferris DX suite is a platform of complementary PaaS and SaaS services. Built on open source technologies, there are four layers of technologies and services, building on top of each other.

## Capabilities

The **Ferris Technology Foundation** is built on an overt and flexible Kubernetes cluster, making its implementation fast and easy. For the same reason, Ferris easily integrates with practically any other technology or services, regardless of its location, be it on premise or any cloud service provider.

**Ferris FX** *(the Executor)* forms the heart for the Ferris DX Suite of **Event driven Services and Integrations** solutions. Soon to be completely programming *language agnostic* it is the Engineers tool to develop, orchestrate and run any combination of services with each other.

With **Ferris SX** *(Streaming Automation)* we have taken a good thing and made it better. While Kafka is already core to the *Ferris DX* suite, Ferris SX forms an optional add-on by which adding new data sources and services into the streaming cluster is made faster and a lot more efficient.

**Ferris Event driven Kubernetes** *(K8X)* forms a milestone in effective and efficient **Kubenetes Cluster Management** - saving valuable time, resources and money! Never has is been so easy to connect containers from across locations with each other, letting K8X automatically and driven solely by triggering events start and stop them.

## Users

Ferris is built for users and teams for an autonomous and effective process and applications development lifecycle.

**Built by Enginers - for Engineers!**

Our goal is to build our solutions to make you lifes easier, and that includes of course writing and bundling product and training documentation with these audiences in mind:

- #### Developers

  With *Developers* we mean everyone who builds and develops services and functions aimed at automating and improving data and service functions. This may be a *Software Developer*, *DevOps*, *Data Engineer* or *Data Scientist*.

  Here's how you get started: [Developer Guide](/docs/overview/ferris_fx/developerguide)

- #### Engineers

  *Platform Engineers* as well as *DevOps* are largely responsible for setting up, maintaining and operating Ferris. This may be as straight forward as on a single cloud instance. But more and more we see Ferris being applied across multiple clouds and on-premise infrastructures.

  Here's how you get started: [Integrations Guide](/docs/overview/ferris_fx/integrationsguide)

- #### Non-Tech (users)

  Ferris is not only for the techies, but also for non-technically oriented users like *Analysts* and *Security Administrators*. And because of that, there is ample documentation provided to explain how Ferris is setup to manage projects and access rights.
