  How to configure a service to be triggered bt the FX Router when a specific type of event is observed on the platform.
---

FX is an event driven platform wich means that each action generating an event can be reused for further triggering of executions. Also within an executing script, an event can be generated and sent as a message. Each event is defined at least by it’s source, type and payload (data). Event message format is following the cloudevents standard. A list of all event types is maintained so the user can bound service execution to certain event type, which means that each time such an event is received, the service execution will be triggered.

# Events

Events are messages passed through the platform which are generated by Services.

Events are in the form of JSON formatted messages which adhere to the CloudEvents format. They carry a Header which indicates the event type and a Payload (or Data section) which contain information about the event.

To have a better detailed understanding of how Events are generated, please refer to the [Architecture](/docs/overview/architecture-overview/ "Architecture Overview") subcategory in the *Overview* category.

## Events

This use case defines how to configure a service to be triggered bt the FX Router when a specific type of event is observed on the platform.

1. Click on *Events* on the left side of the dashboard menu to open drop-down
2. Click on *Event Types* 
3. Check the predefined *Event Types* 
   - ferris.apps.modules.approvals.step_approval_completed
   - ferris.apps.modules.minio.file_uploaded

Events can be created within scripts during service execution by sending a message to the **Kafka Topic** using the `ferris_cli` python service. For example, a service can be bound to a file_upload event that is triggered every time a file gets uploaded to **MinIO** using FX file storage module. New event types will be registered as they are sent to the **Kafka Topic** using the `ferris_cli` python service.

Further details regarding `ferris_cli` can be found in the subcategory [Development Lifecycle](/docs/developerguide/development-lifecycle/ "development-lifecycle") in the *Developer Guide*.
