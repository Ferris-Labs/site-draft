## FerrisFX Architecture Overview

The following provides an in-depth overvew of the FerrisFX Architecture

## Concepts

FerrisFX is based on 2 simple concepts - **Events** and **Services**

### Events

Events are messages passed through the platform which are generated by Services.

Events are in the form of JSON formatted which adheres to the CloudEvents format. They carry a Header which indicates the event type and a Payload (or Data section) which contain information about the event. 

The following is a sample Event.

```json
{
    "specversion" : "1.0",
    "type" : "com.example.someevent",
    "source" : "/mycontext",
    "subject": null,
    "id" : "C234-1234-1234",
    "time" : "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z",
    "datacontenttype" : "application/json",
    "data" : {
        "appinfoA" : "abc",
        "appinfoB" : 123,
        "appinfoC" : true
    }
}
```

### Services

Services are collections of scripts and modules which are executed in sequence. Each script is provided with the Payload of the Event that triggered it. The following is a basic script which parses the event sent above.

```python
import sys
import json

def hello_world(payload):
  print(payload)

payload = json.loads(sys.arg[1])

hello_world(payload)
```

### Service Triggering

Services can be triggered in the following ways

- Manually: By clicking on the 'Run' button on the FerrisFX Management Server.
- On Schedule: As a cron job whereas the Cron expression is added on the UI
- On Event: Where a package is configured to be triggered bt the FX Router when a specific type of event is observed on the platform.

## Required Infrastructure

The following are the infrastructure components required for a FerrisFX installation

| Component         | Descriptio                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Apache Kafka      | Apache Kafka serves as the backbone to pass events and operational data within a FerrisFX Installation. |
| PostgresSQL       | Postgres is used as the database for the Ferris Webserver Application. |
| Consul            | Consul is the configuration store used by the FerrisFX installation. It is also used by the services to store their configurations. |
| Elasticsearch     | Elasticsearch is used as a central store for all operational data. Thereby making the data easiliy searchable. |
| Kibana            | Kibana is used to view and query the data stored in Elasticsearch. |
| FerrisFX-Manager  | FerrisFX Manager is the main UI used for all activities on the FerrisFX platform. |
| FerrisFX-Router   | The Route container is responsible for listenting to events flowing through the system and forwarding the events to the appropriate micro-services that you create. |
| FerrisFX-Executor | The executor container(s) is where the code gets executed.   |

## Understanding the FerrisFX Flow

The FerrisFX platform is intended as an Async platform and therefore at the core of the system messages are passed through the Kafka Message Bus. These 'events' are JSON formatted messages which adhere to the CloudEvents format. 

![image-20211023085329814](/images/diagram_1.png)

Each message consists of what may be simplified as Headers and Payload. The headers indicate the type of event and other attributes. Whereas the payload are the attributes or parameters that are sent out by Services in order to either provide information about their state or for usage by downstream Services.

The FX gateway is listening on the stream ofEvents passing through Kafka. Based on the configuration of the platform the gateway decides if a Service requires to be executed based on the Event contents. On finding a configured Handler the gateway sends a message to the Executor and informs it of which packages or scripts required to be run.

The Executor downloads the package from the Minio storage and executes the package. The Execuor sends a series of messages on package execution and maintains track of the state of teh execution and the metrics. These are once again processed by the gateway and stored either in Postgres or in Elasticsearch based on the tyep of message and the contents.
