## FerrisFX Architecture Overview

The following provides an in-depth overvew of the FerrisFX Architecture

## Concepts

FerrisFX is based on 2 simple concepts - **Services** and **Events**

### Services

**SERVICES** are collections of scripts and modules which are executed in sequence by the FX Executor. 

Services are triggered by **EVENTS**, which are JSON messages which carry a header and payload.

Each script is provided with the Payload of the Event that triggered it. The following is a basic script which parses the event sent above.

```python
import sys
import json

def hello_world(payload):
  print(payload)

payload = json.loads(sys.arg[1])

hello_world(payload)
```

### Events

Events are messages passed through the platform which are generated by Services.

Events are in the form of JSON formatted which adheres to the CloudEvents format. They carry a Header which indicates the event type and a Payload (or Data section) which contain information about the event. 

The following is a sample Event.

```json
{
    "specversion" : "1.0",
    "type" : "com.example.someevent",
    "source" : "/mycontext",
    "subject": null,
    "id" : "C234-1234-1234",
    "time" : "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z",
    "datacontenttype" : "application/json",
    "data" : {
        "appinfoA" : "abc",
        "appinfoB" : 123,
        "appinfoC" : true
    }
}
```

### Service Triggering Methods

Services can be triggered in the following ways

- Manually: By clicking on the 'Run' button on the FerrisFX Management Server.
- On Schedule: As a cron job whereas the Cron expression is added on the UI
- On Event: Where a package is configured to be triggered bt the FX Router when a specific type of event is observed on the platform.

Irrespective of how a Service is triggered it is always triggered by an Event. In the case of Manual and Scheduled triggering it is the FX platform that generates the trigger event.



## Understanding the FerrisFX Flow

The FerrisFX platform is an Async platform. At the core of the platform messages(Events) are passed through the **Kafka Message Bus**. These 'events' are JSON formatted messages which adhere to the CloudEvents format.

Each **Event** consists of what may be simplified as Headers and Payload. The headers indicate the type of event and other attributes. Whereas the payload are the attributes or parameters that are sent out by Services in order to either provide information about their state or for usage by downstream Services.

The **FX Router(s)** is listening on the stream of Events passing through Kafka. Based on the configuration of the platform which is managed in the **Ferris Manager UI** the Router decides if a Service requires to be executed based on the Event contents. On finding a configured Handler the gateway sends a message to the Executor and informs it of which packages or scripts required to be run.

The **FX Executor(s)** downloads the Service from the **Minio** storage and executes the **Service**. The Service may use any Python module that is embedded in the Executor and also use **Consul** for storing its configurations. The Execuor sends a series of messages on Service execution and maintains track of the state of the execution and the metrics. These are once again processed by the gateway and stored either in **Postgres** or in **Elasticsearch** based on the type of message and the contents.



## Required Infrastructure

The following are the infrastructure components required for a FerrisFX installation

| Component         | Descriptio                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Apache Kafka      | Apache Kafka serves as the backbone to pass events and operational data within a FerrisFX Installation. |
| PostgresSQL       | Postgres is used as the database for the Ferris Webserver Application. |
| Consul            | Consul is the configuration store used by the FerrisFX installation. It is also used by the services to store their configurations. |
| Minio             | Minio provides the platform internal storage for scripts and assets used by the Services |
| Elasticsearch     | Elasticsearch is used as a central store for all operational data. Thereby making the data easiliy searchable. |
| Kibana            | Kibana is used to view and query the data stored in Elasticsearch. |
| FerrisFX-Manager  | FerrisFX Manager is the main UI used for all activities on the FerrisFX platform. |
| FerrisFX-Router   | The Route container is responsible for listenting to events flowing through the system and forwarding the events to the appropriate micro-services that you create. |
| FerrisFX-Executor | The executor container(s) is where the code gets executed.   |
