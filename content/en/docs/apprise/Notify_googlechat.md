## Google Chat Notifications
* **Source**: https://chat.google.com/
* **Icon Support**: No
* **Message Format**: Markdown
* **Message Limit**: 4000 Characters per message

For this to work correctly you a GSuite account (there are free trials if you don't have one). You then need to create a Webhook; they can be done as follows:

1. [Open Google Chat in your browser](https://chat.google.com/)
1. Go to the room to which you want to add a bot.
1. From the room menu at the top of the page, select **Manage webhooks**.
1. Provide it a name and optional avatar and click **SAVE**
1. Copy the URL associated with your new webhook.
1. Click outside the dialog box to close.

When you've completed, you'll get a URL that looks a little like this:
```
https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/spaces/AAAAkM/messages?key=AIzaSSjMm-WEfqKqqsHI&token=O7bnyri_WEXKcyFk%3D
                                      ^    ^              ^                  ^       ^                 ^
                                      |    |              |                  |       |                 |
                                     workspace             ... webhook_key...         ..webhook_token..
```
Simplified, it looks like this:
- `https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/spaces/WORKSPACE/messages?key=WEBHOOK_KEY&token=WEBHOOK_TOKEN`

Now it's important to note that while this Apprise plugin uses `gchat://`, you can also just use this URL exactly the way it was provided to you from Google when you copied and pasted.  This is a perfectly valid Google Chat Apprise URL as well.

### Syntax
Valid syntax is as follows:
- `https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/spaces/{workspace}/messages?key={webhook_key}&token={webhook_token}`
- `gchat://{workspace}/{webhook_key}/{webhook_token}`

### Parameter Breakdown

| workspace   | Yes      | The workspace associated with your Google Chat account.
| webhook_key | Yes      | The webhook key associated with your Google Chat account.

apprise -vv -t "Test Message Title" -b "Test Message Body" \
   gchat://AAAAkM/AIzaSSjMm-WEfqKqqsHI/O7bnyri_WEXKcyFk%3D

apprise -vv -t "Test Message Title" -b "Test Message Body" \
