# :heart: Sponsorship and Donations

This project was created and is maintained on the few evenings and weekends I can allocate to it. I pay for many of the notification services Apprise supports so that I can provide support for them and keep everything in working order. Since Apprise supports more than 70+ services, these fee's can really add up.
* :gem: [Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/caronc) goes a long way in helping me cover costs. I've got some great stickers I can ship to you (no matter where you are) for those that help out here! [See here](https://github.com/sponsors/caronc) for more details on this and other cool perks.
* :coffee: Even those who just [buying me a coffee](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=MHANV39UZNQ5E); your contribution is so appreciated and it truly does help support the product!

Thank you to all of those who have already thrown a few dollars my way; your support has been truly appreciated!
