     When you're working on a digital transformation project, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that data is all you need. However, it's important to understand that while data is good and valuable, it’s meaningless on its own — it needs context and purpose..

At Ferris Labs, we’ve been helping companies define and execute their digital transformation for many years.  

But there is one thing that we continuously hear from partners and customers alike: they intend to take a data-centric approach to execute their strategies.

This might seem like a good idea at first, but it’s actually quite dangerous.

All too often, the end result of these “data-full, strategy-empty” initiatives are disconnected and siloed data sets with little or no actionable insights that can end up hurting the business in the long run.

Don’t get me wrong: data is good and valuable. But **data on its own is like oil that sits in a puddle and cannot be harnessed** — it needs context and purpose to understand its value and produce meaningful and value-adding differentiation.

In this article, we’ll talk about the main dangers of a data-only approach to digital transformation and break down what I think is the best way to avoid those pitfalls.

## What exactly does Digital Transformation entail?
When you hear the term "digital transformation," it's easy to get confused. It’s often used interchangeably with the terms "digitalization" and "digitization”.

But the truth is, they all mean different things:

- **Digital Transformation** means the usage of digital products and services.
- **Digitalization** is the automation of business processes.
- **Digitization** refers to the technical process of converting analog data into digital information.

The thing is, **digital transformation as a whole is a massive, global phenomenon.** It's not just about harnessing data — it affects all of us as individuals, too.

The transformation is happening because we're constantly adopting new technologies and services into our lives. Whether you're at work or at home, on your laptop or your smartphone, you're likely part of the shift toward becoming a digital consumer and producer.

This is why it's important for businesses to first understand what digital transformation entails before embarking on their own journey.

To help you get a clearer picture of this process, let’s dive deeper into the role data plays in it.

## The Data-Centric Problem
I might be repeating myself, but there’s no other way to put it: data is good and valuable.

Therefore, **treating data as an important asset is a MUST.**

Data strategies typically pursue a small handful of goals, addressing problems around data completeness, quality, and analytics. For example:

- Source any data type, anywhere, anytime.
- Acquire new sources fast.
- Establish a single source of truth.
- Build a baseline for Analytics and AI.
- Achieve a future-proof digital strategy.

All of these goals make for a comprehensive and sound data strategy, one that will propel companies forward in their maturity level.

_“Ok, so what’s the problem here?”,_ you might ask. Well, it's not that these goals are unattainable. The problem is that they're not specific enough.

While a long-term data strategy provides big benefits in the areas of single-source-of-truth as well as analytics and AI foundation, there are two issues that remain unresolved:

### 1. Data integration and its complexities
**A data-only digital transformation strategy doesn’t address process integrations and connecting applications, services, and enterprise facilities** such as security, networks, or infrastructure into the business and technology value chain.

A lack of visibility into these processes can leave organizations without a clear understanding of where they have gaps or inefficiencies, or how they can best connect with others in their ecosystem.

### 2. Technology and deployment agility
**Another topic that is left unaddressed by data-only digital transformation strategies is the need for agility:** agility to quickly adopt new technologies and deploy them into production.

Today’s reality is that technologies are complex, and the resources needed to apply them are scarce. This means it takes a lot of time and effort to adopt or implement them — especially if technology is not your company’s core competency.

When you add to it the fact that time to market is critical for any new product or service, and thus software deployments are (or at least, should be) clock-driven, it’s easier to see the reach of this problem.

Simply put, **if your technologies and deployment process aren’t agile (meaning that it is difficult to adopt new technologies because of inflexible processes), there isn’t time for adaptations:**

- **The design phase** leaves no room for reconsideration.
- **The build phase** allows for no adaptations for changing requirements or better tools.
- **The operations phase** is stuck with whatever process is adopted.

To sum up, the price you pay for a lack of agility is that the entire software lifecycle becomes slow, unpredictable, and costly.

## So, what’s the ideal solution?
The good news is that what I've mentioned above doesn't have to be so bleak.

While the onus to change is on most enterprises, **there is a solution that addresses all aspects of data strategy as well as enables agile technology and deployment models.**

This ideal state takes into account all of these must-haves, including the ability to revisit and adapt requirements and technologies while still adhering to underlying principles and architecture decisions:

- Agile Data and Process Platform.
- Services and events / micro-integrations.
- Flexible process modeling.
- Cloud agnostic / hybrid cloud enabled
- Integrate with (own) enterprise services
- DevOps / ML Ops / CI/CD
- Use Cases and Applications
- Future proof data strategy

## Data & Service Mesh
You would think that, in order to create a digital transformation strategy that is effective and future-proof, a business needs to have a diverse range of elements in place. However, when it comes down to it, all these elements serve two purposes:

1. Data Mesh
2. Service Mesh

### Data Mesh
The **Data Mesh** is a fundamental paradigm shift, away from the traditional and monolithic Data Warehouse and Data Lake technologies.

![Data Mesh](/images/blog-simplified-data-mesh.png)

_“The Data Mesh architectural design was first proposed in 2019 by Zhamak Dehghani, principal technology consultant at Thoughtworks, a technology company that is closely associated with the development of distributed agile methodology. A data mesh is a distributed, de-centralized data infrastructure in which multiple autonomous domains manage and expose their own data, called “data products,” to the rest of the organization.”_

The advantages of a Data Mesh architecture over any other approach to sourcing and harnessing data are quite straightforward and easy to understand.

Rather than physically sourcing data from its many sources into a central warehouse or lake, it is left in its originating systems. The Data Mesh infrastructure simply connects these systems with each other and leaves it to a services infrastructure to interact, communicate and process data where and when needed.

**The immediate benefits of the Data Mesh are:**

- Fast connecting of any sources
- No need for convoluted   
- Data ownership is left in each domain

### Service Mesh
The complementary equivalent to the Data Mesh is the Service Mesh. Building on the Services Oriented Architecture, its framework of micro-integrations enables fine-grained connectivity between services:

_“Micro-integrations describe an architecture and software development style by which software applications are developed. As opposed to traditional development styles, aiming at developing applications as single units, micro-integrations pursue a modular approach. Hereby, applications are developed as entire suites, consisting of a multitude of events and services, of which each can be managed and deployed independently and as often as desired.”_

In a nutshell, Service Mesh provides a set of features that enable you to monitor, control, and secure your services as well as debug them independently from each other.

This allows you to quickly scale your application by adding or removing services without worrying about affecting the performance of others.

**The immediate benefits of a Service Mesh include:**

- Approachable and low learning curve method.
- Easier error management.
- Simpler maintenance.
- Adaptable services, events, code, and deployment.
- Scalable.
- Faster and continuous deployment.
- Integration.
- Reusability.

Together, the Data & Service Mesh approach goes far beyond the narrow vision of a data strategy.
In fact, it easily represents today’s state-of-the-art software development and deployment methodology, guaranteeing agility, fast development, and effective deployment while requiring less costly technology and hard-to-find engineering skills.

## How to implement Data & Service Mesh: Core Technologies
So, how do you get started?

While it’s not like there is an easy button that automatically installs a fully functioning mesh, here’s a listing of some of the core technologies required to implement a Data & Service Mesh:

- **Kubernetes and Docker:* These may be the most important technology in the Data & Service Mesh because they allow us to deploy applications without worrying about how containers are deployed.
- **Streaming cluster:** This can be Confluent, Apache Kafka, or any other similar system that provides real-time streaming between services.
- **Distributed query engine:** Distributed query engines such as Starburst or Presto/Trino are also needed because they are responsible for querying across multiple databases in your cluster without having to install separate software on each instance of your application.
- **Python, API, SQL, and JSON skills**

## Bottom Line
Digital Transformation is a journey, not an end state. But when done right, each step of the journey brings value.

If you only focus on the data, your digital transformation will be shallow and short-lived. The key to creating real change is to not only have great data but also to understand its limitations and use it strategically to thrive in a digital world

**My advice:** choose your approach carefully and make sure you pause and adapt along the way.

The Data & Service Mesh solutions provide a methodology for organizations to transition from their old, siloed architectures toward more connected, data-rich approaches. This approach allows your business to make incremental progress with each step, ensuring that your digital transformation is always on track.
