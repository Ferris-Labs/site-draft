The Ferris Labs team is excited to introduce **Ferris SX**, the latest addition to their DX Suite.

Ferris SX is a **streaming automation module built on top of Kafka** – the distributed message broker used by thousands of companies to enable data integration across their organizations.

**Ferris SX drastically simplifies the creation of data pipelines and deployment of data streams**, speeding up the time it takes to build stream processing applications.

**It automates sourcing, streaming, and data management**, and widely reduces the need for engineers' involvement in topics management, DevOps, and DataOps.

### What is this article about?
- What is Apache Kafka and what is it used for?
- Common struggles for companies trying to implement Kafka as an integration pattern
- How does Ferris SX address and solve these issues?


## What Is Apache Kafka & What Is It Used For?
Apache Kafka is **the most popular open-source stream-processing software** for collecting, processing, storing, and analyzing data at scale.

Most known for its **excellent performance and fault tolerance**, Kafka is designed to deliver high throughput and at the same time maintain **low latency** for real-time data feeds. It can handle thousands of messages per second with an average latency of 5 - 15ms.

As a distributed commit log, Kafka serves as an ideal platform for building real-time streaming applications such as online streaming analytics or real-time message queue.

Apache Kafka has several advantages over other tools. Some common benefits are:
- Building data pipelines.
- Leveraging real-time data streams.
- Enabling operational metrics.
- Data integration across countless sources.


## Common Struggles For Companies Trying to Implement Kafka as an Integration Pattern
Now, while Kafka is great for building scalable and high-performance streaming applications, it’s actually hard to implement and maintain.

1. For one thing, **the system is large and complex**, which is why most companies fail to meet their goals.

2. On top of that, **integrating client systems with Kafka brings additional challenges** that can be difficult even for experienced teams, because there are many different technical complexities that could potentially cause hiccups in your integration strategy.  -> Data schema, supported protocol, serialization are just some of the examples.

3. As a result, Kafka requires a **dedicated team with advanced knowledge and varying skill sets** to handle its adoption — engineers, DevOps specialists, DataOps engineers, and GitOps experts.

4. Moreover, **it takes a lot of time to build a single stream processing application**. And since most companies need to build 10s or 100s of applications on top of it, the effort quickly becomes significant.

There are many steps involved: from defining and writing business logic, setting up Kafka and integrating it with other services, to automating and deploying the applications.

_Please note that all the points above are based on different use cases companies faced over the years while trying to integrate Apache Kafka._ ¹


## How Does Ferris SX Address And Solve These Issues?
Ferris SX is the latest state-of-the-art addition to the Ferris DX suite, and it takes streaming automation to a **whole new level.**

It's simple – **Ferris SX removes the complexity of Kafka** connections, integrations, setups, automation, and deployments **and gives the end user the opportunity to focus on building client applications instead of losing time learning how to manage Kafka.**

But how exactly does Ferris SX solve the common issues and pitfalls mentioned above? By simplifying all processes:

- **It has a low learning curve:** By reading through the documentation, the end user will be able to start working on the Ferris SX platform and see the first results within an hour.

- **It hides all the complex sides of Kafka:** The developer focuses strictly on business logic for processing messages and the Ferris SX python package takes care of configuration, Kafka connections, error handling, logging, and functions to interact with other services inside the Ferris platform.

- **It’s flexible.** Ferris SX allows you to use different underlying images and install additional components or pip modules.

- **It allows you to connect the code automatically to Streams and Topics.**

- **It helps you to quickly iterate on your service architecture.** With Ferris SX, once the images are deployed and the services are running, results are displayed right away.

- **It takes care of all the underlying core processes.** This means that you don't need to worry about any technical or operational considerations.

- **It is highly scalable** and provides flexibility to up- or down-scale at any point of time, adjusted to the user’s needs and the number of topic partitions.

## Conclusion
Ferris Labs engineers have been working on a daily basis with Apache Kafka since 2015.

With the experience and knowledge they’ve gained over the past 7 years, the Ferris Labs team has built an out-of-the-box module that lets developers concentrate on coding while taking care of all the complex processes that come with Apache Kafka integrations.

The end product is the Ferris SX streaming automation module, released in November 2022.
