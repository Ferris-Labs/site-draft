With so much change around us and such great volatility, do we really need to help organizations adopt a more data-driven mindset?

Don't we all rely on hard facts and cold metrics when making decisions in our professional day-to-day lives?

What's more: Among all the business roles and profiles, wouldn't tech organizations be the most likely candidates to embrace a data-driven paradigm?

Well, _in theory_, yes. But here's the thing:

Having coached large-scale global businesses, scale-ups, and non-profit organizations through fundamentally changing technology epochs, I regularly have been caught off-guard by my over-estimating the change readiness and willingness of organizations.

For many companies, **the biggest obstacle to adopting a data-driven approach is not technical but cultural.** It's easy to define how to embrace data-based change, but much harder to make it an automatic and natural part of the decision-making process for all employees.

In this article, I've put together a small and hands-on collection of best practices that have helped me in the past, after having decided to embark on a technology change journey.

We'll use the adoption of a [data mesh paradigm](https://medium.com/ferrislabs/data-mesh-just-yet-another-rabbit-hole-a88dcfbe070e) as an example here, but most of these suggestions are applicable to other fundamental tech changes within businesses.

Let's dive right in.

## Data-driven changes start with the right agile methodology

**Most technology change projects are, fundamentally, methodology changes.**  We don't usually just replace older technology with newer versions without also implementing a new methodology.

And while it's not required that every single person in the organization becomes a tech wizard and fluent with new tools or systems, understanding the shifts in methodology is key for broad acceptance.

That's why we first need to understand the **differences between bottom-up and top-down change decisions.**

## Bottom-up vs Top-down Decision-Making

Ultimately, most of the top-down decisions made by executives and senior management teams are driven by cost, timelines, and strategic alignment.

In the best of these decisions, the strategic alignment part takes into account the methodology impacts and assesses the downstream effects on the skills of the team or people in question.

However, in truly agile and fluid organizations these impacts are not merely assumed but tested and qualified - **through a bottom-up process.**

This allows for a more thorough examination of the value of each decision, as well as its impact on the company's culture, people, and overall success.

*Pic: Top-down versus bottom up approach*

Therefore, **before going all-in with the latest framework, the fanciest tool, or the newest gadget, you have to make sure you have your bottom-up bases covered.**

If, however, the change in question has been bottom-up induced by your engineers, developers, and data scientists, then this step of the process has probably already been completed.

Regardless, **it's still critical to ensure that the impact from the initial team that has tried and tested a product (e.g., engineers) can be replicated across other tech stakeholders,** so that their respective verdicts will be similar.

Following our example, when implementing a data mesh, these methodology changes really do pile up.

Now, if you already have an agile approach to adopting technology change, then you also need to embrace these concepts:

## Domain-driven design

In a data-driven organization, tech teams are not organized by function or geography, but by business process chains that favor a **holistic client-first perspective.**

Think of it as "procure to pay".

Domain-driven design helps you focus on the real problems your company is trying to solve, making it easier to build an application that delivers value to your customers.

## Product thinking

Interoperable autonomous data products are a mouthful to say, but they are even harder to implement.

Moving from siloed monolithic applications and systems to a network of **cleanly architected components that are compatible and yet dynamic** is at the heart of the data and service mesh mindset.

As a product owner, I have an "inside responsibility" against my stakeholders and an "outside responsibility" against the wider enterprise.

This is important because data-driven products are not just about the final design - they're about keeping the mindset throughout the entire lifecycle, from initial design through implementation.

## Federated governance

The core challenge of adopting a technology change is balancing fast and autonomous decision-making within domains and data products with smart and sustainable oversight to move forward the big picture from a client and economic perspective.

**A federated governance model can help you maintain speed and time-to-market without sacrificing strategic alignment.**

In a federated system, the way data governance should be implemented is defined centrally, but each local domain team can tailor their execution approach based on their needs.

This also allows organizations to be more flexible and adaptive in response to changing environments and new requirements.

## Self-service data platform
SW Engineers, developers, and data scientists need to be enabled and guided. And while this is often equated with more tools and fewer controls it actually should be the opposite:

A reduction to essential tools and standards, and the creative use of them within tight and unambiguous standards.

Think of it as "everything as code". This can be achieved using self-service portals where users can interact directly with their own data without involving external parties like IT departments or other organizations.

## Key Data-Driven Mindset Implementation Challenges

Now you should a better understanding of how important it is to have a solid methodology for implementing every tech change program. But what about building that into our daily practices?

![Implementation Challenges](/images/blog-implementation-challenges.png)

*Pic: TKey Data-Driven Mindset Implementation Challenges*

Well, we usually categorize all potential challenges along an inverted hierarchy of gaps, starting from the basics and working up. So, why am I showing this collection as a triangle instead of as a matrix?

The reason is simple: **The further down you dive into any of the four categories, the more you need focused and specialized groups of people to take on and bridge these gaps.**

And as should be obvious, **the process of embracing a data-driven mindset has to be tackled in a truly holistic fashion across the entire firm.** While technology tools and minds can play an important role in this process, they are not self-sufficient.

Of course, these are only a few examples that are far from conclusive; yet, most organizations find themselves confronting these issues.

In fact, with all the discussions about job enrichment, purpose-led organizations, and open architectures, I'm often baffled by how the focus is almost exclusively on reporting lines and the distribution of power, with little attention paid to accountability or results.

The way I see it, if you are committed to using state-of-the-art technologies but find yourself justifying why waterfall delivery organizations and rigid annual (as opposed to rolling) budgeting need to remain unquestioned practices, then you can save yourself a lot of money and energy by simply staying where you are today.


## How To Embrace a Data-Driven Mindset: FAQs

#### 1. Who can help you make the transition?
Most would say that anyone defending the status quo and the present ways could be difficult to work with; however, these people may have valid reasons for their practices and for holding on to them.

They too had to go through the same struggles to implement and uphold their current (and maybe outdated) standards, which is why your most vocal critics usually make for excellent sponsors - once convinced.

**Hands-on workshops walking through the current vs. the future practice, process, and standards are a great way to answer this question.** They usually flesh out one of two things: 

1. Where your future framework still has gaps to fill and problems you haven't thought of before.

2. What is required in terms of communications and upskilling to convince your team to embrace the new standard.

Looking at the data and service-mesh example, this most often falls along the differences between no-code / low-code tool specialists versus fully-fledged software engineers, with the former (e.g: a data scientist) focusing more on fast-paced and experimental working practices versus the rather rigid and meticulous habits of a data engineer.

And this is not to say that one is more important or better than the other. Instead, it's important to understand why both approaches are necessary during their respective phases along the data product development lifecycle.

#### 2. How do we define progress and when can we start to celebrate it?
I'd say the earlier you start, the better. But here's the thing:

**We typically consider initial data products to be well-scoped when they can be progressed from idea to live implementation in no more than three to four months.** It doesn't matter the enterprise and industry complexity and size, nor does the use case, domain, or functional embedding of the targeted data product.

If you want to do it faster, you'll likely ignore critical framework and methodology elements that have yet to be adopted by your organization or software development process.

And if you plan for more time, you're either sizing the product too big and introducing complexity that can become a showstopper, or not focusing enough on the product agility and independence - which is one of the main benefits and value creators of federated architecture and governance.

Now, the single element most of our coaches at Ferris Labs stumble across most regularly is the notion that everything around a data product is actually contained either as strongly standardized data itself (think JSON or markdown structures) or as executable business logic that acts on top of said data.
For the most part, a data asset is a combination of both aspects. These artifacts are version controlled and accessible using a wide array of self-service platforms.

This stringent approach ensures two key characteristics that become more relevant as your team progresses along its data journey:

1. The **cross-functional collaboration** between subject matter experts, business decision makers, people that know the business processes, and people that know the existing technology (systems and data structures). Any true data product can only be the result of such a cross-functional collaboration.

2. The **re-usability and interoperability** between data products or between a data product and the humans or systems that need to benefit from it. Any mesh can only work if its cells actually fit together and form a bigger whole.

Does this mean that any data mesh can't provide value until it has gone through a massive investment and foundational tech program?

Not at all!

While it is critical to know your business strategy, and ideal to have some architectural guidelines in place, **the great thing about this process is that you can learn as you go** - as long as you make sure that the things you've learned so far and want to leverage for future data products are made known and available to the wider organization.

To start, define which standards are distinct to a single data product, which are domain-specific, and which need to apply to the entire company. But **don't assume that more standardization equals better results.**

The fine balance between speed and agility to create new business value, and the slower but continuous technological convergence across domains and data products is what drives real economic value.

#### 3. How big does this need to be to start with?

This question is most often heard from people who are concerned about small change budgets and the limited capacity of their scarce experts - both in business as well as tech.

My advice? **Start with at least two or three data products and have each of these managed by existing people coached by max two experts who have gone down this rabbit hole before.**

For a data product to succeed, it must be able to deliver new business value. **This means that all the stakeholders involved in the process - from customers to developers - should grasp the ultimate business benefit delivered at the end of the three to four-month period.**

Now, whether this comes in the form of a decision that can be handed over to an algorithm, a manual process that can be automated, or simply a client making a better decision is almost unimportant.

### Final Words

A data-driven mindset is the result of a collaborative and agile effort between your organization's teams and business decision-makers, and the subject matter experts that can help you improve the quality of data-oriented technology change throughout your company.

ge, skills, data, and decision power) to bring the use case or "data opportunity" from the whiteboard to production.

And once the first one or two of such teams have tasted success and are able to communicate it within their immediate network, the organization will have taken its first step toward a major turning point:

A state where all new business change ideas are evaluated on a similar scale, rather than getting lost in tech, process, or organizational responsibility quarrels.
